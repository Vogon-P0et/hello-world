# Is Your Bite Causing Health Problems? A Guide to Bite Correction 

Are you experiencing unexplained headaches, jaw pain, or worn-down teeth? The culprit might be something you rarely think about - your bite alignment. At Northpoint Dental in Jacksonville, we regularly help patients understand and correct bite issues that affect both their oral health and overall well-being.

## Understanding Bite Problems: More Than Just Aesthetics

A misaligned bite (malocclusion) occurs when your upper and lower teeth don't come together properly. While some people might only notice the cosmetic impact, bite problems can lead to serious health issues that extend far beyond your smile.

### Common Signs of Bite Misalignment

* Frequent headaches or migraines, especially in the morning
* Jaw pain or clicking sounds when eating
* Uneven or accelerated tooth wear
* Difficulty chewing or biting
* Neck and shoulder tension
* Teeth grinding (bruxism)
* Speech difficulties
* Facial asymmetry

## The Hidden Health Impact of an Incorrect Bite

### TMJ Disorders
When your bite is misaligned, your jaw joints (temporomandibular joints or TMJ) work harder to compensate. This extra stress can lead to TMJ disorders, causing pain, limited jaw movement, and chronic headaches.

### Dental Damage
Misaligned teeth often create uneven pressure points when biting. Over time, this can result in:
* Cracked or chipped teeth
* Premature tooth wear
* Weakened enamel
* Increased cavity risk
* Gum recession

### Digestive Issues
Proper chewing is the first step in digestion. A misaligned bite can affect how thoroughly you chew your food, potentially leading to digestive problems.

## Types of Bite Problems We Treat in Jacksonville

### Overbite
When upper teeth significantly overlap lower teeth, often causing lower teeth to bite into the roof of the mouth.

### Underbite
Lower teeth extend beyond upper teeth, affecting facial appearance and chewing function.

### Crossbite
Some upper teeth sit inside lower teeth when biting, potentially causing asymmetrical jaw growth.

### Open Bite
Front teeth don't meet when biting, making it difficult to bite into foods and affecting speech.
